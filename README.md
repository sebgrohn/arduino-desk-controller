# Arduino Sit–Stand Desk Controller

This is the Arduino sit–stand Desk Controller that lets you extend your simple sit–stand desk with a timer.
If you have dumb a desk with only two buttons – one for driving up and one for driving down – this Arduino sketch automates your sit–stand cycle by hooking into the signals sent to the control unit of the desk.
